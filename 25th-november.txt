First Comment: So the only EV maker in California is taken out of the program to protect small California EV makers that did not exist?

Haters do hate.

User: Jaxon9182
First Comment: Although it is obviously law fare, it is funny and smart how they make it seem like a good thing meant to help small EV makers. The irony is that in "green" California where Newsom supposedly cares so much about the environment he is supporting legislation that will directly reduce the rate of EV adoption in the state

User: SerennialFellow
First Comment: Aligns with Elon stating Tesla doesn‚Äôt need credits

User: I_am_darkness
First Comment: This is stupid and petty.

User: tech01x
First Comment: This is likely unconstitutional Bill of Attainder to try to use marketshare to "punish" a specific company. Especially since Tesla's marketshare of all vehicles is tiny, even in California.

Plus CA would be sued delaying any implementation and likely Tesla would win.

And Republicans in Congress can write a law that supersedes California's law, which would completely justify Musk's switch to Republicans because of Democrat's use of lawfare against him and his companies.

User: stanley_fatmax
First Comment: Playing political favorites with industry didn't play out well on the national stage, I'm not sure why they'd want to reproduce that on the state level. Excluding the largest producer of EVs does nothing to help the environment. It reeks of playing the invisible hand, picking favorites, cheating competition.



Also, the article calling Newsom a presidential hopeful is sort of funny. Even if somewhat popular in California, him and his policies poll terribly nationally. I'd go out on a limb and call him unelectable - his reputation is tarnished, especially with the current state of his state.

First Comment: Isn't Tesla the only car manufacturer in California?

User: nexelhost
First Comment: The level of childish behaviors on the radical left is astonishing. Offering subsidies based on market share (ev market share to be more specific to target Tesla). Either you want ev for the environment or you don‚Äôt. Not sure why you‚Äôd attack the company building in your state and helping your states coffers in favor of giving money to foreign brands and out of state sellers. The lack of economic common sense just to be petty and get your media attention

User: gtg465x2
First Comment: Ah yes, punish millions of Tesla buyers / potential voters because you don‚Äôt like the CEO. Great way for a presidential hopeful to win votes! /s

First Comment: Newsome is a grade A idiot

User: Underwater_Karma
First Comment: This proposal is to exclude vehicles based on manufacturer market share.  Since over 50% of every electric vehicle sold in California is a Tesla, The intent to exclude Tesla is clear. 

I'm not sure how much Faith we should put in the claim that this is to encourage other manufacturers to ramp up EV production rather than a simple legislative Fu to musk

User: Alarmed_Crab
First Comment: This is response to Elon asking for the end of subsidies to get rid of the competition. There's no other reason - he thinks Tesla can absorb the shock, and smaller manufacturer won't. So Newsome is retaliating. I don't love it, especially since Tesla is building in CA too. But regulatory capture by Elon is a pretty low blow.

User: Emotional-Benefit716
First Comment: Did anyone read the article? It wouldn't be just Tesla excluded, it would be based on market share, so other large manufacturers most likely as well.

User: mrroofuis
First Comment: I hope all the speculation about ending the IRA is just that, speculation. 

The battery requirements go up every year. So, technically,  nobody needs to do anything and most cars won't even qualify for the credit. 

It's been a big incentive for the industry.  I hope it remains in place

User: Glenohumeralus
First Comment: when you pick a side, you get pros and cons that comes with that. that's why company should never pick side with politics and stay neutral as possible.

User: ImpressiveBoss6715
First Comment: Its kinda dunny to see Elon Musk c riders who say this is horrible....but Elon musk helped the guy who wanted to remove the credits in the first place. 

Not a single word about that but WHOA anti Elon Musk post thats a top priority

User: SouthbayLivin
First Comment: Have to remember, Tesla is no longer a California EV company. The only California EV companies now, are Lucid and Rivian.

User: ComoEstanBitches
First Comment: Elon said they don't need incentives so lets put his money where his mouth is at: if Tesla misses targets because of CA then Elon gets pushed out as CEO so investors can finally get a full time Tesla CEO. Tesla is resting on its laurels selling regulatory climate credits  as it throws darts at AI and robotaxi pipe dreams instead of innovating their cars.

First Comment: Everything Gavin sucks

User: dbv2
First Comment: What a Socialist run State.  How can Newsome get elected?  He will run it in the ground and that State will go bankrupt.   Too bad as such a beautiful State!

User: Toastybunzz
First Comment: Stupid and petty describes much of how the politics in this state works. I don't doubt that they will implement it and keep doing it until they get a slap on the wrist from the Feds. Intentionally singling out the company thats one of the biggest driver in moving people to EV because they're mad at the CEO is stupid and hypocritical. Then again it's California so I shouldn't be surprised.

User: Embarrassed-Pen-2360

User: ElGuano
First Comment: I asked about this as well and didn‚Äôt get a good answer. Someone mentioned a ‚Äúlaser projector‚Äù but what it accomplishes I‚Äôm not sure.

User: UkuleleZenBen
First Comment: This would be a great way for pedestrians outside the car know that the car is aware of them, therefore easing navigating around the car, and being able to read its intentions. (At night at least)

User: Unusual_Answer4074
First Comment: This is just a simple Galvo based Show Laser Projector (or 2 of them in the Lightbar) and was for sure only meant to give some futuristic effect on the Event. No way this will be in Production vehicles in that configuration‚Ä¶. Pictures could already be made via HD Matrix Headlights.

User: mocoyne
First Comment: The event was initially postponed from August to October so that a "change could be made to the front of the vehicle." During the demonstration, at the beginning of the event we briefly saw what appeared to be the cab projecting 2 images on to the ground in front of it. The overhead shot when Elon got out of the car showed that these images were being projected from the center of the light bar, separate from the headlights on the outside. I don't see this being used later in the event. I have not seen anyone discuss this or bring it up since the event. Are we assuming this was the delay? What's the purpose? Displaying messages? Showing people where it's looking?

  
edit: [

Link to the actual event. You can see they actually turn on at around this point. Maybe something to do with the scene being so dark?

User: Turbulent-Abroad7841
First Comment: This was one the biggest mistakes tesla made in the reveal. They didn't give us enough info. Like why is the light projection used and what happens in case of a malfunction. Hopefully tesla does another event where they actually show more of their future ideas.

User: thebiglebowskiisfine
First Comment: LED matrix headlights. [

User: soeffingsick
First Comment: I wondered this too since they didn‚Äôt mention anything about it at the event but it reminded me of this from Audi [audi projection lights](

User: 10xMaker
First Comment: Matrix Headlights that all models come with now should be able to do that eventually with over the air updates. It probably might be very low in the priority list.

User: charlie_xmas
First Comment: That would so cool if it displayed the direction it intends on going for people to be aware!

User: Life_Connection420
First Comment: I don't get the point of this discussion. As a pedestrian, I look around to make sure I keep out of harm's way. I don't expect a car to watch out for me.

User: Sahed__
First Comment: yeah, whats up with that??? i have a feeling its just for show? but they told gave such little info.

User: committedpoints
First Comment: It's lidar. You can tell because of the rolling shutter artifacts in the 2nd clip if you watch the actual video. This matches the horizontal scanning that lidar does. Probably the camera taking these didn't have an IR filter due to low light. The lidar is probably a behind the windshield design but tesla mounted 2 units closer to the middle of the headlight bar (which is really smart).

User: ParksNet30
First Comment: Makes sense for the 0.1% of moments that need human override like emergencies, accidents, navigating unusual car parks or road closures.

User: ackermann
First Comment: If Tesla is actually able to achieve some sort of Robotaxi service in the next 2 or 3 years, what do we think it might look like?  

Probably restricted to 2 or 3 cities, like Waymo?  Restricted to good weather and daylight hours, at least at first?  I know FSD anecdotally seems to do well in moderate rain, but I‚Äôm sure the reduced visibility degrades it somewhat (as it does for human drivers, too) and they‚Äôd likely want to reduce risk as much as possible at first.  

Blacklisted from certain roads, even within the selected cities?  Construction, and such.  One of Tesla‚Äôs biggest advantages is probably all the data they‚Äôve collected from customer cars with FSD.  Compared to Waymo, they should have great statistics on which roads have lots of disengagements, and which rarely do.  

Pickup and dropoff restricted to areas with easy parking and not too congested?  

Will they allow any freeways, at first?  I don‚Äôt think Waymo does.  Today‚Äôs Teslas seem to do best on freeways, but of course, the consequences of a mistake can be even more deadly at freeway speeds‚Ä¶

User: SodaPopin5ki
First Comment: If this is their short-term solution to FSD in robotaxies, it could be applied to consumer owned Teslas.  Either in use as robotaxies, or with a "driver" using FSD.

I doubt we'll see this, due to the scale issues, though.

User: sevaiper
First Comment: Of course they are, it‚Äôs both smart and tends to be a regulatory requirement. As the software improves they can track how many interventions they need to make as a quality metric.

User: cryptoengineer
First Comment: Given this ability, what I really want is an app which will let me drive the car while sitting in it, even if restricted to 1 mph. That will let the owner to get the car out of stuck situations.

User: LurkerWithAnAccount
First Comment: As a northeast USA driver, the update from .2 doesn‚Äôt seem like any change from an FSD perspective. Chuck Cook‚Äôs recent drive seems to confirm the same. 

I agree with his assessment that it ‚Äúfeels‚Äù like the truck doesn‚Äôt know its own size or handling. It starts slowing down too late, makes occasional and necessary abrupt stops, turns are better than the very first iteration but still feels like it‚Äôs cutting things too close or makes a mid turn jerk correction. 

We also need the speed profiles the new M3/MY have.

First Comment: For those interested, these videos were filmed at RSI Locations in Pomona, CA. Although now it is primarily a filming location, it used to be a psychiatric hospital for the "insane" called Lanterman Developmental Center. Supposedly lobotomies were regularly performed here. And now Teslas test how fast they can go without hitting a stationary child.

First Comment: I had to intervene three times this weekend going ~65mph with traffic at a standstill hundreds of yards in front of me. I let FSD go as far as I could before I took over and as far as I could tell it had no plans of stopping and would‚Äôve rammed in to the dozens of cars in front of me. Houston TX.

First Comment: Maybe I missed it but what version is this testing on?

User: Knowledge_VIG
First Comment: Waffling on turns is an issue I've noticed, along with approaching exit ramps at too high a speed. It also will take exit ramps or enter a normal turn lane too late confusing traffic

User: Fancy_Load5502
First Comment: Salt Lake City experience: 

It struggles with double left turn lanes, especially if there is some action soon after that which makes one lane clearly superior to the other. 

SLC often has very deep sutters due to storm water runoff being massive. A driver has to slow considerably and approach at an angle to avoid scraping and/or damaging the front of the car. FSD has no concept of this at all. 

Phantom braking remains the absolute worst part of owning a Tesla (I've had it for nearly 4 years).

User: TheReal-JoJo103
First Comment: Wow, this is so much less than I previously had the impression of them doing. What is this? Compliance regulation? Is this an official Tesla account?

I‚Äôve had FSD since day one. It has improved, whatever they‚Äôre doing is working. Will it reach unsupervised, I don‚Äôt know. This feels like a tremendous step back and I don‚Äôt understand how this should give anyone confidence. 

A closed course should be exactly what a model excels at and not an indication of real world performance, no? I don‚Äôt live on a desert street. Am I not supposed to be more concerned that they have someone drive it around a closed desert street to help decide it‚Äôs ready for everything?

I‚Äôve seen the simulations and real world data they show off. What is this and why shouldn‚Äôt I be worried!?

User: soapinmouth
First Comment: 12.5.6.3 has been absolutely fantastic, it's fixed a lot of my gripes with the later 12.x versions and freeways are now super smooth and confident. I've taken a number of long 30-40 mile trips now from home to places with 0 interventions. People in the car wouldn't know I wasn't driving if I didn't have hands off. While sometimes it drives a bit slow, the whole point to point including freeway experience with no hands is just so awesome I tend to just let it go, people can go around if they need to.

User: djh_van
First Comment: So to be clear, was the teat vehicle stationary on a test rig, and the scenery is projected infront of/onto the glass so the driver feels as if they are there? And I'm assuming the FSD computer is "seeing" it's input directly from data sent to it fromDojo? Or are my assumptions all wrong?
