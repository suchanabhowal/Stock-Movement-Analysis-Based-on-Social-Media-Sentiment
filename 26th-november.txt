First Comment: If you use your own code for yourself does this mean that you can pick any other color and qualify for the tax credit on the performance model?

First Comment: I just ordered. I‚Äôm so scared they are gonna change this back to 500.

User: MindTheFap
First Comment: Truly happy for all who can benefit from this! This is a great incentive by Tesla. Sad that I have no-one to refer in my circle of friends üò≠

User: 5pctoff
First Comment: If I have an order but am waiting for delivery, will the advisor likely help me adjust the pricing?

(I asked the advisor but I‚Äôm waiting for an answer right now ‚Äî they typically respond in 2 days)

First Comment: I'm not referring anyone to Tesla. Their customer service is trash. Picking a different EV when I am done with my model Y.

User: putinhuylo99
First Comment: They are trying hard to compensate for Elon Musk's behavior pushing customers away. They wouldn't be doing any discounts if the sales were steady or climbing.

First Comment: This is the same guy who made sure his minimum wage bill excluded his buddy's company.

User: OkBlock1637
First Comment: Not a fan of the tax credit period. With that said creating a new tax credit, then excluding a manufacturer from your own state, then subsidizing manufacturing outside your state, is perhaps the worst policy proposal I have seen in a while.

User: s2ksuch
First Comment: I give Ro Khanna some credit.. putting politics aside to do the right thing.

User: Underwater_Karma
First Comment: It's like he can't even understand that he's attacking his state residents, not Elon Musk

User: Short-Service1248
First Comment: Spoiler, the dems have learned nothing

User: darveesh
First Comment: Former advisor to Obama and Tesla VP of policy. A stalwart democrat: 

‚ÄúSubsidizing vehicles made in South Carolina, Georgia and Mexico, but excluding vehicles made by Californians in Fremont would truly be insane.  Can‚Äôt imagine CA will unfairly treat its own workers this way‚Ä¶‚Äù

Gavin is DUMB.

User: Holiday-Island1989
First Comment: Ro gets it! Imagine if Biden didn't do that stupid EV summit and acknowledge that GM was leader of EV vehicles, when Tesla made more EVs in a single day then GM did in an entire year. This really hurt Elon's ego so this probably pushed him to doing whatever he could do to make sure Biden didn't get reelected.

User: wish_you_a_nice_day
First Comment: But he said Tesla doesn‚Äôt need any credit. And proceeded to back an election on the anti EV side.

User: acorcuera
First Comment: Democrats for you. They never learn. They‚Äôre doubling down.

User: No-Tale-1499
First Comment: Yeah‚Ä¶so this is the reason they lost this election.  We are tired of the lawfare.  Laws or lawsuits specifically designed to attack a political opponent.

User: qwerty1_045318
First Comment: Nah, gonna jump in and say Newsom is right here‚Ä¶ not only is Elon in support of getting rid of the federal EV tax credits, he also bank rolled the guy running on that promise and he himself is leading the department that is going to make those tax credits go away. Musk said in a call with Tesla investors that doing away with the tax credits benefits Tesla because it hurts the other car manufacturers more, paraphrased of course. Tesla is about the only company able to make a profit on EVs at the moment, which is the whole point of the tax credits in the first place, let the companies charge what they need to but also make the cars affordable with the tax credits. And to top it off, they aren‚Äôt limiting it to just Tesla, it‚Äôs going by market share, so again, if the purpose of the tax credit is to allow people to buy cars that are otherwise too expensive, this does that and encourages competition‚Ä¶ and when Tesla drops below the threshold, by other car companies catching up to them, then the tax credits would apply to their cars as well

First Comment: Elon should move all of his business out of California.  It‚Äôs a failed state.

User: Salty_Leather42
First Comment: Elon has been saying Tesla doesn‚Äôt need the tax credit and he‚Äôs right , they proved on the first round of credits that they can just lower prices. Manufacturers just ramping up likely need a bit of help still, no big deal. Tesla will still dominate the market, it might simply result in not killing competition completely - good for consumers in the end as it makes for competitive offerings.

First Comment: Y‚Äôall act like he is not going to shut down Fremont anyways

User: chucknthem
First Comment: Vote Newsom out.

User: Rip_Topper
First Comment: Man I was so proud in 2019 to buy a vehicle designed, engineered and built in California.  First shock was when I discovered the tax credits for Teslas were burned up when I purchased - I think I got $43 back instead of $7,500. Then I learned the HOV lane stickers only lasted for 2 years.  Now our governor wants to punish the single EV maker building cars in the state.  Brilliant.  Losing the tax credit would suck - but enabling HOV use for the life of the vehicle would be a nice - and nearly free - benefit

First Comment: Newsom is a fucking idiot. His help the dems if he slimes his way into the nomination in ‚Äò28.

User: Researchguy1625
First Comment: Over time Musk realizes he must ultimately move everything out of California. My company stopped doing business in California years ago because the overbearing regulatory requirements and restrictions reduced profitability to the point of walking away. I felt it was better to take a temporary reduction in sales to focus on areas where we could make our target returns. Best decision we ever made. 100 Californians lost their jobs but gladly most were happy to move to our other locations In others states.

User: SolenoidSoldier
First Comment: I support having them, but removing EV tax credits is a band-aid we'll need to rip off eventually and if they're going to remove them federally, I don't see how a transition for state EV credits should be any different. Teslas are amazing vehicles and the company is flush with cash while the others are still playing catch-up, so frankly, I don't care. Competition is good. Let's face it, Elon only cares about the success of his business and not the industry as a whole.

User: Past_Explanation69
First Comment: They need to get rid of all tax incentives on EV, it's doing nothing but hurting the industry

User: TrashCapable
First Comment: Since Elon is all about efficiency he probably would be on board with these cuts right?

User: Foxhound199
First Comment: Elon's made his bed. Now he has to sleep in it.

First Comment: Punitive Liberalism is so stupid

User: no_f-s_given
First Comment: But Elon doesn't want there to be EV tax credits. So Newsom is really just giving him what he wants.

User: Herebec
First Comment: Tesla needs to replace Elon as CEO

User: Anonymoushipopotomus
First Comment: The thinking is that Tesla will be the only one to receive the EV credits once the bills are rewritten to make it so. Newson is just incentivizing the other manufacturers to stick around there.

User: RogueDisciple
First Comment: Can we expect Newsom to double down and seize Tesla due to Musk being a "Russian Asset"?

User: IAmDiGlory
First Comment: Shouldn't be CA taxpayers money that helps these companies make profit. Make good products at economic value to make profit

User: BringMeTheRedPages
First Comment: Scrap EV subsidies.

HOWEVER, 

Allow BYD entrance into the American market, which also has messy political implications, since BIDEN opted to slap a 100% tariff on Chinese EVs.

China could care less, since they're trouncing competition, including Tesla, in nearly every other non-American market.  It's... staggering.

User: FANGO
First Comment: Apparently we have learned nothing, because nobody "snubbed Tesla at the Biden EV summit."

It was a union summit. Elon's just an egomaniac and invented his own narrative.

User: PikachuPho
First Comment: At this point I'm happy that Newsom is going against apartheid Clyde.  Everything he stands for these days disgusts me

User: pnwloveyoutalltreea
First Comment: Sadly the cyber truck in garbage and so is musk so sure, leave the illegal immigrant out of the tax subsidies.

User: NoScope_Ghostx
First Comment: If it gets Elon to leave Tesla‚Ä¶I‚Äôm all for it.

User: Xalucardx
First Comment: But didn't Elon said not having a tax credit will benefit them? Why is he crying now?
