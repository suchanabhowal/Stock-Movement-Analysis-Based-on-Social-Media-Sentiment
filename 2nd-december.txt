First Comment: is there a gofundme set up already or should i start one?

User: wspman
First Comment: i don’t even agree with most of musk’s recent actions but what’s the justification for this? He set lofty goals that most thought was unachievable at the time, and the company hit them. Whether that’s fair or not now is irrelevant, a deals a deal and the shareholders voted to uphold it.

EDIT: Encourage you all to read through the thoughtful replies from others, the case is more nuanced than most people realize. I’m not sure of the true correct answer without reading much deeper into it, but I hope the result is determined based on true legal merit rather than political opinions. 

If there is legal basis for the claims that he unfairly created this compensation package deal  - then the deal should be canceled (regardless of the shareholder vote, it’s important to protect minority shareholders as well that’s the responsibility of the law). If there is no such legal basis, then the man should get his money.

First Comment: So a pay package worth more than 6 times the yearly income of the company before taxes.


What are shareholders waiting to run away from this company? It would be insane even if it were 10% of that amount.

User: luscious_lobster
First Comment: So maybe now they can get a real board

User: JackDenial
First Comment: I vividly recall this pkg as if it happened yesterday. The way the tranches were structured ensured that if he failed to meet each lofty goal, he would receive zero or nothing.

CEOs publicly ridiculed the package’s unachievability and questioned why a CEO would agree to such an unrealistic goal.

While the judge is correct in asserting that he has influence over the board, she is mistaken in claiming that it was unfair or excessive. As others have mentioned, the package was upheld by shareholders twice, with nearly unanimous support.

User: tigole
First Comment: Good, but $345m for the lawyers seems excessive too.

User: TheBurtReynold
First Comment: I’m not a lawyer, so I don’t have an opinion _on the law_ that’s worth listening to (opinions are like assholes, and all…) — wish 99% of people on social media would admit similarly

User: PackageHot1219
First Comment: I wouldn’t call it a loss… what’s he going to do? Stop being the CEO?  At this point it would probably be a net positive.  He has too many distractions and he too has become the distraction… so much so that I think Tesla would be better without him.

First Comment: Every Tesla employee should get a $500k bonus instead.

User: Kitchen_Set_3811
First Comment: Just the lawyer fee award by the judge is half the [current record $688 million ]( legal fees awarded in 2008 in litigation stemming from the collapse of Enron.

This will be payed by the shareholders who voted AGAINST her decision twice in a case about protecting shareholder.

User: Brendog1776
First Comment: I would like to see proof of them knowing that tesla was going to be worth what it is today. At the time, Elon was mocked for such a deal as tesla wasn't even profitable at that point.

User: domiran
First Comment: Tesla "loses" bid? I don't think Tesla *lost* anything. $56B, whether it's stock options, cash, or a mix, is insane for a CEO.

The ruling was that it was a breach of fiduciary duty, that the board was too heavily influenced by Musk because he has ties to many of them.

User: 5_yr_lurker

User: monizzle
First Comment: I find it hard to feel bad because even a pay package of 56bn is obscene.   The fact that anyone thinks that amount of money should be in possession of a single person shows a deep moral and intellectual failing of America.

User: No-Independence828
First Comment: This is stupid. Shareholders voted twice for it

User: ZoomHigh
First Comment: Me and my (almost meaningless shares) voted against this. The judge laid out the reasons for her ruling clearly.

For me, it was clear that there was no reason to award the CEO the entire net profits of the company to-date in one year. Elon made plenty of money with the shares he already owns - enough motivation to keep him pretending he's really smart for another 10 years.

User: Possible_Version2680
First Comment: This shall go to the Supreme Court of Delaware. Corporations will also leave Delaware. This judge is a dipshit. 

The shareholders voted twice for this to happen. She doesn’t control Tesla, the shareholders do.

User: HamtaroHamHam
First Comment: A lot of people on these comments pretending to be lawyers... 🤣🤣

User: Fun-Sundae4060
First Comment: This judge is a biased dipshit. Fire them.

What kind of precedent does this set when courts have more power to decide how executives are paid than by shareholders?

User: Adorable-Emotion4320
First Comment: Can I ask how does this pay work in practice? With 100B in revenue and 1100 in total market cap this seems to be massively impacting the company negatively.


I understand the are share options, does it mean the counterparty have to buy up shares on the market when they are exercised, or are they created diluting the existing shares?

User: syredditor
First Comment: Lol

User: Yafka
First Comment: I've been reading but I haven't seen an answer yet.  I know Musk can appeal this ruling, but if that too fails, what is his next legal recourse?

User: IMB413
First Comment: I'm no lawyer but I don't really like the idea of a judge interfering with a BOD action approved by shareholders.

But I think it's pretty hard to argue there's no conflict of interest when there's a guy named Kimbal Musk on the BOD.

User: imfrmcanadaeh
First Comment: Well I confused by a couple of things here: 

1) That shareholders would even consider diluting their shares by then $56b (now closer to $101b) and voting for this twice. Honestly if you are stupid enough to vote yes to this you should get what you deserve. Honestly I think Elon Musk have provided some wicked drugs just before the vote. 

2) that a court can overrule this decision which seems crazy. But maybe it is justified since the holders were likely influenced in some way. 

3) That I'm supposed to feel bad for Elon...? One of the richest men in world isn't going to get richer by an absurd amount that 99.9999% of the rest of the world can only dream of. Let me write that number out so every one can maybe understand how much this is. $101,000,000,000.00 compared to the average middle class wage in America $50,000.00.
I really hope that makes you all feel really small because that dollar value is absolutely absurd and nobody deserves to be compensated by that amount. Most people would be extremely happy receiving the just the multiplier of their dream of a million dollars.  Elon isn't God, and even if he was, that amount is still not justified! Every single person on earth could have recieved $12. This amount is insane.

First Comment: Who would’ve thought that Tesla shareholders wouldn’t be able to overthrow a court’s judgement. Maybe there’s hope for the US after all.

User: ken830
First Comment: Not sure why there's even an argument. Just look around anywhere. Shareholders want the package to go through and are disappointed with this. Non-shareholders are cheering at this. The stock price falls dramatically when the package was rejected the first time. The stock price rallies when the shareholders approved it a second time. It's crystal clear what is good for TSLA shareholders and what is bad.

User: TestPilot68
First Comment: This judgement is completely irrelevant other than as a speedbump.

If appeals in Delaware don't work, another vote will be taken in Texas.

If that doesn't work, SCOTUS. 

If that doesn't work, legislative solution

If that doesn't work, executive override.

User: Paythapiper
First Comment: Miss the era where judges weren’t political hacks

User: dev_hmmmmm
First Comment: So what is the next step? Appeal to higher court? Or just say f it and quit and start unloading his stock?

Tesla stock share will crumble to at least 1/4 of the current price if Musk decide to wash his hands of it. Let's face it it's as absurdly high as it is because of his brand name, justifiable or not.

Then once the price crumbles, he can just make offer with 30% premium or so to buy the entire Tesla and no one will reject it since the board have duty to maximize shareholder value. 

He can also use SpaceX as vehicle to take over Tesla after he unloaded all Tesla stock so to avoid conflict of self dealing.

He did so and now this shares are worth more but a deal is a deal.

Pretty sure next judge will bring back justice.

User: InterscholasticPea
First Comment: It’s a bizarre ruling. She is upholding a ruling that she sees as protecting the business and its shareholder. But she fails to understand Elon is the business.  Without him, there won’t be a Tesla, at least not in its current valuation.  the shareholders don’t agree with her.  

Does shareholders proxy/votes matter anymore? Or is it simply by an opinion of a judge on the definition of excess?   Tesla is no ordinary company so I think it’s out of her depth.  

At the end of the day, is she really protecting shareholder interests?

Luckily, there is a due process here to double, triple check.

First Comment: I will wear my Apple Watch more once this is released.  It's not that I want to go without my phone on occasion, it's that I sometimes have the car not recognize my phone in my pocket and I have to assume having the device on my wrist be able to be recognized as a key will help that.

User: chrisdh79
First Comment: From the article: Tesla has [revealed]( an app designed for the Apple Watch and says it should be live by next week.

The Tesla app for the Apple Watch will do much of what the smartphone app does – it doubles as a key, can open up the trunk or the frunk, activate climate control, and show battery charge level. 

Tesla announced the app as part of a large swathe of updates; we counted 18 large updates and eight minor updates. They include the ability to watch Dashcam and Sentry Mode clips directly from the Tesla smartphone app and save them to your phone to edit or share; custom Cybertruck wraps and license plates; and set a preferred battery charge level for when you arrive at your destination.

But perhaps the most important Tesla update is the ability to prank your friends with a whoopie cushion fart sound whenever they sit down in a passenger seat.

User: OlorinDK
First Comment: I already use shortcuts to open frunk, aso. But being able to use watch as a key will be nice, as I sometimes have my phone in my back pocket and that’s apparent too far away…

You have to go into your settings on your phone and turn off bluetooth or it'll open the doors if left in the car. It's not a big deal, but you basically have to do it every day, and carry the key card and it gets a little old.

But the only thing I needed was unlocking the door.

One time my phone locked up from too many wrong password attempts.   Sweating while biking was pushing the buttons.

I was locked out of my car.  Was never going to let that happen again so got the watch app.

User: DepartureNo1441
First Comment: Very excited for this update. As a runner/trail runner who does not like to carry my phone, I have always been disappointed I could not use my Apple Watch as a key. However, small grip, but do other Tesla drivers really use the frunk that often that it needs to be on the Home Screen of the watch app rather than the trunk? For me, I rarely use the frunk usually only after hiking/running and my shoes are too dirty to go in the car. Maybe other people have found a more practical use for it?

First Comment: 2020 MS, really excited for more "minor fixes and improvements"

User: kinupeiphone
First Comment: Just got it.

User: TiramisuAlreadyTaken
First Comment: Now that my initial disappointment has subsided I am excited for some of the features. Passenger seat control, nice!. I regularly pack the car full of stuff and need extra room behind the passenger seat. 
And that reverse alert, nice! 
Percentage at arrival? Nice finally!
Traffic on route. Nice.
But what the f*** are you on about, radar image of precipitation. Like I am gonna say nah I'm gonna skip work today it's raining. 💩

First Comment: Any idea of the version number yet?

User: CarltonCracker
First Comment: Decent list but still bummed out we have no 5.1 or Atmos after that (likely fake) rumor circulated 2 years ago.

It can't be that hard to at least do 4.0.  I use a 4.0 setup for a lot of my Atmos listening and it's fantastic.  There are diminishing returns with center and hight speakers at least with music.

If FSD hadn't gotten soo good this year I'd be looking at Lucid/Mercedes/Cadillac who all support it. I know I'm probably an extreme minority, but it would be a nice feature.

First Comment: The updates should provide what was promised and what everyone bought the car and FSD for. While it’s nice to have, did anyone buy a Tesla to stream music? And who pays for fart sounds, light shows, games, and Santa? Don’t know who’s grand idea were these fractured updates but it’s gotten old and the games aren’t cute anymore. Other car companies are catching up and beating us to the tech punch (BYD for instance) and we are getting excited over streaming apps. Lol! (Rant over)

First Comment: Pretty sure ya'alls update turned off your brake and tail lights.

Drove past 7 Teslas this morning, of various types, and none of them had working brake or tail lights. Enjoy all the accidents you all are about to cause...

First Comment: Setting battery percentage on arrival! Finally. Sometimes I don’t want to end up at my destination with 9% remaining, especially if I know there’s no supercharging in the immediate area.

First Comment: Yes! Been asking for a weather map overlay

User: CUL8R_05
First Comment: Installed on my 2021 M3 LR intel. No weather overlay but not a problem for me. Accessing sentry / dashcam clips is great. Adjusting passenger seat - very handy.

User: spatel14
First Comment: Man was hoping for some FSD updates for HW3 but oh well, these features are pretty good

User: krazineurons
First Comment: Cries in 2016 Model X. Pretty sure none of the features will make it there.

User: ufbam
First Comment: When you buy your Optimus. The tele-operation kit will come with it. Then you can help teach it speciality tasks. Or just carry them out remotely like an avatar. 
The tele-operation has always been a feature. But when they post stuff but forget to specify if it's autonomous straight away, they get accused of trying to trick people. 
It's fucking awesome however you slice it!
